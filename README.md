Prioritize Registrations: View registrations prioritized by course credits using a priority queue.


**Data Structures Used**:

ArrayList: To store the list of courses and students.

LinkedList: To manage the queue of course registrations.

Stack: To maintain a history of registrations for the undo functionality.

PriorityQueue: To prioritize registrations based on course credits.
